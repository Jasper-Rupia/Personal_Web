                    Hi! Learn a bit about me.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I'm Jasper Rupia Katunzi. I am a student at Mzumbe University 2 years now for ICT studies. The world is changing rapidly, and I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time to get more experience and succeed in heavier projects.

                    Why studying technology.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Have you wondered that technology is a big part of your life? Or maybe too much of your life? But the truth is technology helps us in many ways. Smart phones can help you keep your calendar straight, some personal technology helps improve fitness and exercise, and other technology improves life at home with advanced new washers and dryers, microwaves, and automatic coffee machines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, three specific reasons that technology is good is that it saves lives by improving medicine, keeps us connected to each other, and provides education and entertainment.
